This repository contains the solution used in my YouTube video showing ways of building Blazor Focus Trap components, with or without the use of JavaScript.

The YouTube video mentions how the Focus Trap may need to set focus on its first render or second render depending on how it is used, and as such its important to remember to toggle the components Disabled parameter i.e true initially and then when for example opening a modal dialog to false, most likely just using the inverse of the variable used to for the a dialogs show paraementer. 

The video is only ten minutes long, so if you stumbled across this repo, it may be worth taking a look as the video serves as the documentation.

YouTube video : Should be posted later today, will update when I have the link.
